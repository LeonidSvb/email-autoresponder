# AI Email Autoresponder

Intelligent autoresponder for cold outreach that generates human-like replies in seconds.

## Why Speed Matters

Research shows that responding within 5 minutes increases positive reply rates by **15-30%** compared to delayed responses. Leads go cold fast - this system ensures instant engagement while you focus on closing deals.

## What It Does

- **Classifies intent** - Automatically detects if a reply is positive, curious, neutral, objection, or hard no
- **Generates human responses** - No robotic AI tone. Replies sound like a real operator wrote them
- **Flags manual reviews** - Complex questions (pricing, competitors, multiple asks) get routed to you

## Integration

Connects directly with your sending tools:
- Instantly
- SmartLead
- PlusVibe
- Lemlist
- Any tool with webhook/API support

Also integrates with CRMs (HubSpot, Pipedrive, Close, etc.) via webhooks or Zapier/Make.

## Customization

Prompts are tailored to your specific service and tone. We adjust:
- Your positioning (connector, agency, SaaS, etc.)
- Response style and length
- Calendar booking flow
- Objection handling approach

## How It Works

The system uses **few-shot prompting** - each response category has curated examples of ideal replies that guide the AI to match your communication style. Combined with strict formatting rules (max word counts, no salesy language, no greetings), responses stay natural and on-brand.

## Demo
